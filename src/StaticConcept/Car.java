/**
 * 3 objects will be created and copies og all the 4 vars will be given to objects
 * 100 objects are there than 100 copies of all the 4 var will be given to objects
 * But wheels vars has same value in all the objects which is 4
 * Wheels memory allocation = Which is taking 4 bytes *3 objects  = 12 bytes in the memory
 *
 * So, wheels is a property of the object but value of wheels is common for all the object which is 4.So we are un necessary assigning for each and every object
 * wheels is common property value(The value is common) for all the cars, so we can make it static so that it will be stored in CMA and will take only 4 bytes in memory
 * Tomorrow if we are creating 100 objects then wheels=4 will take only 4 bytes and not 400 bytes
 * name,chasisNumber,price - Values are not common - so they should be non-static - And every object should have individual copy
 *
 * common value means static property
 * non-common value means non-static property
 *
 * When we create system 80% will be non-static members and 10/20% will be static members
 * So by keeping that in mind java people has created "per generation" with fix memory allocation
 * per generation is static memory - up to 1.7 we had meta space with static memory - which was causing memory issue when we have more static members
 * Meta space is dynamic memory - from 1.8+ - we have More dynamic memory in nature
 * So concept of meta space is -> once meta space is full then it will start taking space on the RAM automatically/dynamically
 *
 * We don't have GC for meta space

/**
 * Real time examples
 * üí° 1. Utility / Helper Classes (Common in Automation)
 *
 * When you create a utility class like DriverUtil, ExcelUtil, FileUtil, or WaitHelper,
 * you make methods static so they can be used directly without creating an object.
 *
 * public class DriverUtil {
 *
 *     public static void waitForElement(WebElement element) {
 *         System.out.println("Waiting for element to appear...");
 *     }
 *
 *     public static void click(WebElement element) {
 *         element.click();
 *         System.out.println("Clicked on element");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * // ‚úÖ Usage (no need to create object)
 * DriverUtil.waitForElement(loginButton);
 * DriverUtil.click(loginButton);
 *
 * Real-life scenario:
 * In Selenium frameworks, classes like DriverManager, WaitHelper, or ConfigReader often have static methods.
 *
 *
 * üíª 2. Static WebDriver in Selenium Frameworks
 *
 * Used to share the same driver instance across all test classes.
 * public class BaseTest {
 *     public static WebDriver driver;
 *
 *     public static void initDriver() {
 *         driver = new ChromeDriver();
 *         driver.manage().window().maximize();
 *     }
 * }
 * Usage:
 * BaseTest.initDriver();
 * BaseTest.driver.get("https://example.com");
 *
 * ‚úÖ Why static?
 * Because we want one shared driver across test cases, not one per object.
 *
 * üßÆ 3. Static Variables for Common Constants
 *
 * Real use: storing global config, timeouts, or URLs.
 *
 * public class Constants {
 *     public static final String BASE_URL = "https://amazon.in";
 *     public static final int TIMEOUT = 10;
 *     public static final String BROWSER = "chrome";
 * }
 *
 * // ‚úÖ Usage
 * System.out.println(Constants.BASE_URL);
 *
 * Why static?
 * Because constants are same for all tests, no need to create new Constants() every time.
 *
 *
 * üè¶ 4. Bank Account Example (Static Variable for Shared Value)
 *
 * A static variable is common to all objects ‚Äî like a bank‚Äôs name.
 *
 * public class BankAccount {
 *     static String bankName = "HDFC Bank";  // common for all accounts
 *     String accountHolder;
 *     double balance;
 *
 *     public BankAccount(String name, double bal) {
 *         this.accountHolder = name;
 *         this.balance = bal;
 *     }
 *
 *     public void showDetails() {
 *         System.out.println(accountHolder + " - " + bankName + " - ‚Çπ" + balance);
 *     }
 *
 *     public static void changeBankName(String newName) {
 *         bankName = newName;
 *     }
 * }
 * Usage:
 * BankAccount a1 = new BankAccount("Dhaval", 20000);
 * BankAccount a2 = new BankAccount("Ravi", 35000);
 *
 * a1.showDetails();
 * BankAccount.changeBankName("ICICI Bank"); // static method changes value for all
 * a2.showDetails();
 *
 * üßæ Output:
 * Dhaval - HDFC Bank - ‚Çπ20000
 * Ravi - ICICI Bank - ‚Çπ35000
 *
 *
 * üß† 5. Static Block ‚Äî Used for One-Time Setup
 *
 * A static block runs only once, when the class is loaded.
 *
 * Used for loading config, setting up drivers, reading property files, etc.
 *
 * public class ConfigLoader {
 *
 *     public static String baseUrl;
 *     public static String browser;
 *
 *     static {
 *         // This runs once when class loads
 *         baseUrl = "https://example.com";
 *         browser = "chrome";
 *         System.out.println("Config loaded successfully!");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Usage:
 * System.out.println(ConfigLoader.baseUrl);
 * ‚úÖ Real-life: You can use static blocks for one-time initialization in frameworks.
 *
 *
 *
 * üì¶ 6. Static Factory Method (Design Pattern Example)
 *
 * Example from Java libraries and frameworks:
 * public class WebDriverFactory {
 *
 *     public static WebDriver getDriver(String browser) {
 *         if (browser.equalsIgnoreCase("chrome"))
 *             return new ChromeDriver();
 *         else if (browser.equalsIgnoreCase("firefox"))
 *             return new FirefoxDriver();
 *         else
 *             throw new RuntimeException("Invalid browser");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Usage:
 * WebDriver driver = WebDriverFactory.getDriver("chrome");
 *
 * ‚úÖ Why static?
 * Because factory methods return instances ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need an instance of the factory itself.
 *
 *
 *
 * üßæ 7. Static Counter ‚Äî Tracking Objects Created
 *
 * public class Employee {
 *     static int count = 0; // shared among all employees
 *     String name;
 *
 *     public Employee(String name) {
 *         this.name = name;
 *         count++;
 *     }
 *
 *     public void show() {
 *         System.out.println(name + " | Total Employees: " + count);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Usage:
 * Employee e1 = new Employee("Dhaval");
 * Employee e2 = new Employee("Ravi");
 * e1.show();
 * e2.show();
 *
 * üßæ Output:
 * Dhaval | Total Employees: 2
 * Ravi | Total Employees: 2
 *
 * ‚úÖ Static variable count keeps track across all instances.
 *
 *
 *
 * üß∞ 8. Static Inner Class (Used in Builders / Frameworks)
 * Static inner classes are used when the inner class doesn‚Äôt depend on outer class instance.
 *
 * Example ‚Äî Builder Pattern:
 * public class User {
 *     private String name;
 *     private int age;
 *
 *     private User(UserBuilder builder) {
 *         this.name = builder.name;
 *         this.age = builder.age;
 *     }
 *
 *     public static class UserBuilder {
 *         private String name;
 *         private int age;
 *
 *         public UserBuilder setName(String name) {
 *             this.name = name;
 *             return this;
 *         }
 *
 *         public UserBuilder setAge(int age) {
 *             this.age = age;
 *             return this;
 *         }
 *
 *         public User build() {
 *             return new User(this);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 *Usage:
 * User user = new User.UserBuilder()
 *                     .setName("Dhaval")
 *                     .setAge(28)
 *                     .build();
 *
 *‚úÖ Common in frameworks like Selenium PageFactory, Lombok builders, etc.
