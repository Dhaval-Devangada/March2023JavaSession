    //What is problem with above method?
    //Every time new object will be created when the above method is called.So heap size will get increased
    //So what should we do to overcome this problem?
    //we can create global object - There is not concept of global object - if we write "new Employee()" inside the method then whenever we call t3() then object will get created
    // To resolve this we have - call by reference
    //So before moving to the concept, we have to understand the problem statement first. What is a need of that?
    //Here the problem is we are creating new object whenever we call t3() -> so think like what is the necessary/most important thing to call m1()?
    //someone is calling t3() then t3() has to call m1()
    //What we need to call m1()(which is in object) from t3() (Which is in meta space) => The reference
    //So why don't we communicate with "object reference" and use the "object reference" to call the methods of the object
    //so that is why concept known as "call the method by reference"

        Browser browser = new Browser();
        browser.b2();
